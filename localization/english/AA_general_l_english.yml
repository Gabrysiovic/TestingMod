They assembled at the Palais des Bourbons, where they announced the overthrow of the Emperor and the proclamation of the Third French Republic. The Bonapartist forces were unable to oppose them, and were forced with great reluctance to acknowledge what had happened."

To save the country in danger, they claimed for the Republic: it is announced, and this revolution is led to the public law’s and public safety’s names.
